## 💼 Professional Background  

I am a Staff-level Applied Research Scientist at Oracle Cloud where I’ve helped lead the design and build-out of globally deployed services spanning pre-trained Generative AI, Responsible AI, Object Detection, Invoice/Receipt Key-Value Extraction, Custom KV/DOCUMENT AI, Medical Imaging, as well as their Auto-ML variants. I currently lead some efforts in the Generative AI division.  

Previously, I served as Tech Lead at Signify (formerly Philips) for new deep-learning applications, working on innovative services such as Lightfinder and Global Streetview Audit. I was also a Research Scientist at Amazon, focusing on ML-driven automation for employee decision making and performance management — efforts that contributed to company-wide adoption of new recommendations.  

My work has resulted in over 60 patent applications (20+ granted) and multiple peer-reviewed publications. I hold a Ph.D. in Optimization, a B.Sc. in Engineering, and an MBA.

## 📂 Experience  

### **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure**  
**Staff Applied Scientist** — 12/2020 – Present  
- **Current role (2025):** Reasoning & Agentic AI Lead — spearheading launch of an end-to-end multi-task automated prompt-optimization framework, now extending to agentic use-cases. Leading state-of-the-art foundation model research and development, model reasoning, and test-time augmentation for accuracy enhancement.  
- **2023–2024:** Generative AI & Responsible AI Lead — delivered inference-protection services, domain-specific LLM fine-tuning (summarization, VQA, chat & generation), tool routing, prompt optimization, and multi-modal embedding model development via multi-task training (using Slurm, Axolotl, Accelerate, DeepSpeed, etc.). All services are customer-facing and revenue-generating.  
- **2022–2023:** Document AI Science & Tech Lead — built Invoice/Receipt/Custom Key-Value extraction, Health Insurance Card OCR models, and prototype Generative AI services for upcoming launch.

Oversaw the full lifecycle — from conception and data curation (terabyte-scale datasets) to architecture design, performance benchmarking, deployment, user testing, and service launch. Achieved > 20% improvement over comparable cloud offerings (GCP, AWS, Azure) in latency and/or accuracy.  
- **Additional responsibilities:** Infrastructure & architecture design (ARM vs GPU, cluster training), auto-ML & hyperparameter search, efficient multi-cluster training, incremental & class-sampling learning, code review, hiring, mentoring, stakeholder coordination, IP/patents, system design and mid-term strategy planning.  

Technologies & architectures used include variants of: Llama, DeepSeek, CodeLlama, Qwen, YOLOv5, Mask R-CNN, Detectron2, LayoutLMv2/v3, SDMGR, BERT, EfficientNet, Stable Diffusion / DALL-E, deBERTa, LlamaGuard/PromptGuard, plus training/serving frameworks like DeepSpeed, Axolotl, Llamafac, and more. Techniques included: reasoning & chain-of-thought, SFT, pre-training, DPO, RLHF, model distillation, tool-calling/agent frameworks, automatic prompt optimization, multi-modal embedding, test-time augmentation, embedding techniques, and efficient inference strategies.

### **Amazon — Research Scientist Lead (ML/AI)**  
**09/2019 – 11/2020**  
- Led projects in statistical ML and deep learning — including generalized embedding modeling (a precursor to LLMs) and large-scale proprietary data analytics.  
- Projects included internal asset modeling, company-wide asset output measurement (productivity), cost & compensation optimization, change analysis, multi-rater attribution, forecasting, and long-term productivity analysis under uncertainty.  
- Developed and deployed novel methods for event attribution, promotion/attrition analysis, long-run asset optimization. Led a “Science-as-a-Service” framework and an ML feature repository that reduced generic model development times by up to 70%. Provided mentoring to junior members and had project proposals accepted for large confidential initiatives.

### **Signify / Philips Research North America — Research Team Lead, New Deep Learning Applications**  
**(01/2018 or 2015) – 08/2019**  
- Managed a team of 5+ PhD researchers and interns working on deep-learning based Computer Vision, Generative Networks, Time-Series Analysis, and Smart Cities / Streaming Data Analytics.  
- Led development of:  
  - **Lightfinder**: computer-vision based e-commerce shopping app — achieved a jump from ~30% to ~97% top-1 accuracy in wild (real-world) tests by optimizing deep-learning models (Inception-V2/V3, ResNet, VGG, Mask RCNN, YOLO, etc.), using advanced augmentations, parameter and grid search, and resolution tuning. App deployed on iOS and Android, with strong revenue potential.  
  - **StreetView Audit & Sensor Data Analytics**: scalable deep-learning based remote audit for outdoor sensor networks — including satellite imagery registration, scalable segmentation/detection pipelines (Mask R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, etc.), enabling large contracts.  
  - **Generative Adversarial Networks**: proposed and built a novel multi-domain emotion-conversion GAN for unpaired data (first unpaired GAN paper accepted at Interspeech 2019). Explored object in-placement and photorealistic style transfer, and compressive sensing for IoT sensor data. Collaboration with academia (e.g. MIT).  
  - **Satellite Imagery Asset Localization**: developed U-Net & bootstrapped sequential label-generation pipelines for aerial object detection/localization in high-resolution satellite imagery. Collaborated with academic partners (e.g. MIT) and industry (DigitalGlobe).  
  - **Sensor & Time-Series Analytics & Edge Computing**: developed compressive-sensing and model-compression techniques (teacher-student networks) for edge deployment, achieving over 95% compression, enabling ML on constrained compute devices. Also worked on infrastructure-as-a-service pricing models for long-term sensor-based contracts.
