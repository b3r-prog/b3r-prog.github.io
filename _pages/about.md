# Hello, I’m Laitan (Dr Olaitan Olaleye)  
**Principal Machine Learning Scientist** — specializing in large scale generative modeling, foundation modeling, ***reasoning***, computer vision & agents.

I help lead the build-out of state-of-the-art models and production-grade systems that bring generative AI and enterprise ML solutions into real-world use. My work spans from automatic prompt optimization, natural language processing and reasoning to computer vision and medical imaging, always with an emphasis on real-world impact and revenue generation. I work at the intersection of SOTA-grade ML and robust real-world implementations: from fine-tuning large language models and multi-modal systems, to designing scalable GPU-based solutions and arhitecting custom auto/ml and resource efficient solutions.

## What I Do  

- **Generative & Foundation Models** — Reasoning, LLMs, multi-modal models, prompt optimization, instruction tuning and adaptive model choice.  
- **Multi-modal & Reasoning Systems** — combining vision, language, structured data; building reasoning layers and bridging modalities for complex tasks.  
- **Computer Vision & Medical Imaging** — segmentation, detection, classification on MRI/CT; deep-learning pipelines for clinical imaging.
